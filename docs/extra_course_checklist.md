# How to Get The Most Out of This Course

Need to do MORE then just follow along with the course and finish the application.
I NEED TO ------>

1. Do as much Debugging on my own, DON'T go straigh to the Q&A and google!

2. Create original, EXTRA features for the application and implement them **myself** to actually make the skills stick!

3. Understand **WHY** the instructor is doing what he does in the video.

4. If i dont understand any terminologies or underlying 'why's then i need to google it and note it down in this file
